# SAMPLE_VEHICLE_PLAYER

This is a description and user manual of the sample included in the [Samples Pack](https://github.com/AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack).

## Goal

Vehicle Player is a feature of SCANeR™ that allows simulated vehicles to follow exactly a recorded trajectory. 

> In the User Manual: `5.5.10. Player model`.

Vehicle Player uses its own data format. Data acquired from measurements or third-party software must be converted.

`📄 Source data file` → `📄📄📄 SCANeR™ Vehicle Player files`

The source data contains the position of one or several vehicles over time.

This sample shows how to convert the source data using a Python script.
The input format is XML, but the script can be adapted to take other formats as an input.

## How to use

Pre-requisites:
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)
* [Pyproj 1.9.6](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/1.9.6/)

### Step 1. Convert the vehicle trajectory data

1. Move to the workspace folder `SCANeR-Samples-Pack-2022\APIs\samples\VehiclePlayer\ConvertFromXML`.

   *	*The file `example.xml` contains test data exported from the third-party software PreScan.*
   *	*The script `convert.py` can read, transform and save the data in the format of Vehicle Player.*
   *	*The folder `template/` is a dependency of the script.*

2. In a console (cmd), call the script `Python convert.py example.xml`

   *Output files are in `example_vhlplayer/`.*

### Step 2. Use the vehicle trajectory data

3. Place the converted files in the SCANeR data hierarchy.

   ![Data Hierarchy](assets/data_hierarchy.png)

5. In SCANeR studio, load the configuration SAMPLE_2022_VEHICLE_PLAYER ([how?](../HT_Change_work_environment/HT_Change_work_environment.md)).

   > :point_right: Just to be sure, refresh the file index with `menu TOOLS > Update resources`.

6. Create a new scenario `menu FILE > New Scenario`

   > *Use the provided terrain `example` in the list.*

7. In the RESOURCES panel, look for the converted vehicle `hostvehicle`.

8. Start the simulation

   *The vehicle moves according to the input data.*

   > The error below may appear in the log.  
   > They are the result of a known bug, but they do not prevent correct simulation.
   > ```
   > ERROR 1: Missing BASEGEODCRS / BASEGEOGCRS / GEOGCS node 
   > ERROR 1: PROJ: proj_create: unrecognized format / unknown name 
   > ERROR 6: Cannot find coordinate operations from `' to `EPSG:4326' 
   > ERROR 1: PROJ: proj_create: unrecognized format / unknown name 
   > ERROR 6: Cannot find coordinate operations from `EPSG:4326' to `' 
   > ```
   > You can ignore those.

## Explanation

### Projection System

The input geographic coordinates will become projected coordinates.

![Projection Schematic](assets/projection_schematic.png)

The projection system depends on the region. In the script, the lines below must be changed according to your data location:
```python
#Projections
inProj=Proj(proj='latlong',datum='WGS84')
outProj=Proj(init='epsg:28992', towgs84='565.417,50.3319,465.552,-0.398957,0.343988,-1.8774,4.0725')
offsetX = 171338.11
offsetY = 388410.20
```

“EPSG” and “TOWGS84” codes can be found on [epsg.io](https://epsg.io/).

### Terrain

Both files under `example_terrain/` contains the road network associated to the imported data.
*	`example.osm` is the source data.
*	`example.rnd` is the SCANeR Terrain after import of `example.osm` in the Terrain editor.

## Go further

### Multiple Vehicle Player instances

It is possible to import several vehicle trajectories.
For example, if there is more than one vehicle trajectory in the input XML, the conversion script will produce several vehicle files.
Once drag & dropped into your scenario, you’ll have them in the hierarchy.

![Vehicle Hierarchy](assets/vehicle_hierarchy.png)

Each vehicle will need its own ACQUISITION and MODELHANDLER modules.

![Multiple Vehicles Modules](assets/mult_veh_modules.png)

Finally, each vehicle instance can be linked to its dedicated modules in the Vehicle Instance Setup window.

* `Vehicle > Vehicle Process`
* `Driver > Driver Process`

### Replay GUI

The Replay GUI is a SCANeR™ module that helps the use of Vehicle Player.
