## SCANeR Samples Pack

The Samples-Pack contains ready-to-use SCANeR configurations. Created by our engineers, it is a great source of inspiration and an opportunity to study best practices. Avoid the anxiety of a blank page and use these examples as starting points for your own projects.

> **Get the samples pack on Github: [AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack](https://github.com/AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack)**.

If you would like to see new demonstrations added to the Samples-Pack please contact us or [open a request on GitHub](https://github.com/AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack/issues). We may have some scenarios that we can share, or we may take your comments into account in the next revision of the SCANeR Samples-Pack

### Get started

* [ADAS test and validation: create your test case to validate your ADAS](./Pages/HT_ADAS/HT_ADAS.md)
* [How to run a massive simulation to test and validate an ADAS](./Pages/HT_Massive_Simulation/HT_Massive_Simulation.md)
* [Headlights simulation: connect your AFS model](https://stockage.scanersimulation.com/Evaluation/2021/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_HEADLIGHTS_Tutorial.pdf)
