If you want to go further with SCANeR, register to one of our online [technical events](https://www.avsimulation.com/events/). They are 45 minutes long, hosted by our engineers, cover a wide range of topics (...) and are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNNe9SaA3LjCFb2qXmhkoA). 

## SCANeR

## SCANeR Samples Pack

The Samples-Pack contains about 30 ready-to-use SCANeR configurations. Created by our engineers it is a great source of inspiration and an opportunity to study best practices. Avoid the anxiety of a blank page and use these examples as starting points for your own projects.
If you would like to see new demonstrations added to the Samples-Pack please contact us or open a request on [GitHub page](https://github.com/AVSGuichet/Samples-Pack/issues). We may have some scenarios that we can share, or we may take your comments into account in the next revision of the Samples-Pack

### Get ready

* [Download and install the Samples Pack](./Pages/HT_InstallSamplesPack/HT_InstallSamplesPack.md)

### Get started

* [ADAS test and validation: create your test case to validate your ADAS](./Pages/HT_ADAS/HT_ADAS.md)
* [Headlights test and validation: create your test case to validate your projectors' strategy](./Pages/HT_Evaluate_and_validate_AFS/HT_Evaluate_and_validate_AFS.md)

### Samples Manuals

Below you will find the documentation (.pdf) for the examples of the Samples Pack that do not yet have a dedicated tutorial.

* [Camera capture](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_CAMERACAPTURE_Manual.pdf): fetch and sort camera outputs
* [FMI](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_FMI_Presentation.pdf): exchange I/O between SCANeR and a MiL with FMI
* [Headlights](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_HEADLIGHTS_Tutorial.pdf): interface an Adaptive Frontlight System (AFS)
* [Pixel lighting](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_PIXEL_LIGHTING_Manual.pdf): modify in real time projectors photometry
* [Scenario importer](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_SCENARIO_IMPORTER_Presentation.pdf): import real world data and generate your SCANeR template scenario
* [Vehicle player](./PDF/SCANeRstudio_EVAL_VEHICLE_PLAYER_Manual.pdf): ask your vehicles to follow a recorded trajectory
